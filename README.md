# HKIS APAC App

This is a project started by Kristel Fung, Miyona Katayama and Jewels Lin. 

We hope to create a functioning website holding all of HKIS's APAC media, including photos and livestream in an effort to boost school spirit and increase sports coverage.

Furthermore, we are creating a phone app that shows live scores of the games being played at HKIS.
